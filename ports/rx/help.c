"Quick overview of commands for the board:\n"
"  pyb.info()    -- print some general information\n"
"  pyb.delay(n)  -- wait for n milliseconds\n"
"  pyb.millis()  -- get number of milliseconds since hard reset\n"
"  pyb.Switch()  -- create a switch object\n"
"                   Switch methods: (), callback(f)\n"
"  pyb.LED(n)    -- create an LED object for LED n (n=1,2,3,4)\n"
"                   LED methods: on(), off(), toggle(), intensity(<n>)\n"
"  pyb.Pin(pin)  -- get a pin, eg pyb.Pin('X1')\n"
"  pyb.Pin(pin, m, [p]) -- get a pin and configure it for IO mode m, pull mode p\n"
"                   Pin methods: init(..), value([v]), high(), low()\n"
"\n"
"Pins are numbered by board specific name, or by their MCU name\n"
"Pin IO modes are: pyb.Pin.IN, pyb.Pin.OUT_PP, pyb.Pin.OUT_OD\n"

"Control commands:\n"
"  CTRL-A        -- on a blank line, enter raw REPL mode\n"
"  CTRL-B        -- on a blank line, enter normal REPL mode\n"
"  CTRL-C        -- interrupt a running program\n"
"  CTRL-D        -- on a blank line, do a soft reset of the board\n"
"  CTRL-E        -- on a blank line, enter paste mode\n"
